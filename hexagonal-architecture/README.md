# Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

## Overview
Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters, isolates the core business logic from external concerns by defining clear boundaries between the application core and its external interfaces. This architecture ensures that the business logic remains independent and testable.

## Architecture Principles
- **Ports and Adapters**: Clear separation between business logic (ports) and external implementations (adapters)
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core business logic doesn't depend on external frameworks
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested without external dependencies
- **Framework Independence**: Easy to swap out different implementations

## Hexagonal Architecture Concepts

### Ports (Interfaces)
Ports define the contracts that the core business logic expects:
- **Repository Ports**: Data access interfaces
- **Service Ports**: External service interfaces
- **Event Ports**: Event publishing interfaces

### Adapters (Implementations)
Adapters implement the ports for specific external systems:
- **Web Adapters**: HTTP controllers, REST APIs
- **Database Adapters**: Repository implementations
- **External Adapters**: Third-party service integrations

### Core Business Logic
The hexagon contains pure business logic that:
- Doesn't depend on external frameworks
- Uses only port interfaces
- Can be tested in isolation
- Remains stable over time

## Benefits
- **Testability**: Core logic can be tested without external dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (database, UI framework)
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries prevent architectural decay
- **Independence**: Business logic remains independent of external concerns
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new adapters without changing core logic

## Best Practices
1. **Port-First Design**: Define ports before implementing adapters
2. **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies should point inward toward the core
3. **Interface Segregation**: Keep ports focused and specific
4. **Adapter Isolation**: Each adapter should be independent
5. **Core Purity**: Keep core business logic free of external concerns

## Use Cases
- **Microservices**: Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure
- **Complex Business Logic**: Applications with rich domain models
- **Multi-Channel Applications**: Same business logic across different interfaces
- **High Testability Requirements**: Applications requiring extensive testing

## Trade-offs
- **Pros**: Highly testable, flexible, maintainable
- **Cons**: More initial setup, can be complex for simple applications

## Common Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access
- **Service Layer**: Business logic coordination
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling through events
- **Dependency Injection**: Invert control of dependencies
