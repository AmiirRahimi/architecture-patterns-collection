# Traditional MVC

## Overview
The Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: Models for data and business logic, Views for user interface, and Controllers for handling user input and coordinating between Models and Views.

## Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct responsibility
- **Model-View Separation**: Views don't directly access models
- **Controller Coordination**: Controllers handle user input and coordinate components
- **Data Flow**: Clear flow from View → Controller → Model → View

## Project Structure

## MVC Components

### Models
- **Purpose**: Represent data and business logic
- **Responsibilities**: Data validation, business rules, data persistence
- **Example**: User model with validation and business methods

### Views
- **Purpose**: Present data to users
- **Responsibilities**: UI rendering, user interaction, data display
- **Example**: React components that render user interfaces

### Controllers
- **Purpose**: Handle user input and coordinate between Models and Views
- **Responsibilities**: Request processing, business logic coordination, response handling
- **Example**: API route handlers that process requests and return responses

## Data Flow
```
User Input → Controller → Model → Service → Database
     ↑                                         ↓
     └── Response ← Controller ← View ← Model ←
```

## Benefits
- **Clear Separation**: Each component has a specific role
- **Familiar Pattern**: Well-known and understood architecture
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features following the same pattern

## Best Practices
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
2. **Thin Controllers**: Keep controllers focused on coordination
3. **Fat Models**: Put business logic in models
4. **View Independence**: Views should not directly access models
5. **Service Layer**: Use services for complex business logic

## Use Cases
- **Web Applications**: Traditional web applications with clear data flow
- **CRUD Operations**: Applications with simple create, read, update, delete operations
- **Team Familiarity**: Teams comfortable with MVC pattern
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick development of standard web applications

## Trade-offs
- **Pros**: Simple, familiar, well-documented pattern
- **Cons**: Can become complex with large applications, potential for fat controllers

## Common Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access in models
- **Service Layer**: Complex business logic coordination
- **Middleware Pattern**: Request/response processing
- **DTO Pattern**: Data transfer between layers
