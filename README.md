# Next.js Architecture Patterns Collection

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of 10 different architectural patterns implemented in Next.js applications. Each project demonstrates a specific architectural approach with practical examples, proper folder structures, and detailed documentation.

## Purpose
This collection serves as a **learning resource and reference guide** for developers who want to understand different architectural patterns and their implementation in modern Next.js applications. It showcases how the same functionality can be structured using various architectural approaches.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: This repository is **NOT meant to be run as a single application**. Each folder represents a separate architectural example that demonstrates different organizational patterns. These are reference implementations for educational purposes.

## Architecture Patterns Included

### 1. [Clean Architecture](./clean-architecture/)
- **Focus**: Separation of concerns with dependency inversion
- **Best For**: Enterprise applications, complex business logic
- **Key Features**: Domain-first design, framework independence

### 2. [Feature-Based Structure](./feature-based/)
- **Focus**: Organization by business features
- **Best For**: Large teams, product development
- **Key Features**: Team autonomy, code locality

### 3. [Layered Architecture](./layered-architecture/)
- **Focus**: Horizontal layers with clear responsibilities
- **Best For**: Enterprise applications, long-term projects
- **Key Features**: Clear separation, maintainability

### 4. [Modular Monolith](./modular-monolith/)
- **Focus**: Independent modules within a monolith
- **Best For**: Medium to large applications, microservices preparation
- **Key Features**: Team autonomy, deployment flexibility

### 5. [Colocated Structure](./colocated-structure/)
- **Focus**: Organization by technical concerns
- **Best For**: Small to medium applications, rapid prototyping
- **Key Features**: Easy discovery, simple navigation

### 6. [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](./domain-driven-design/)
- **Focus**: Business domain-centric organization
- **Best For**: Complex business logic, large teams
- **Key Features**: Ubiquitous language, rich domain models

### 7. [Hexagonal Architecture](./hexagonal-architecture/)
- **Focus**: Ports and adapters pattern
- **Best For**: Microservices, framework independence
- **Key Features**: Testability, flexibility

### 8. [Traditional MVC](./traditional-mvc/)
- **Focus**: Model-View-Controller separation
- **Best For**: Web applications, CRUD operations
- **Key Features**: Familiar pattern, clear data flow

### 9. [Atomic Design](./atomic-design/)
- **Focus**: Hierarchical component organization
- **Best For**: Design systems, large applications
- **Key Features**: Consistency, reusability

### 10. [Serverless-First](./serverless-first/)
- **Focus**: Event-driven, function-based architecture
- **Best For**: Microservices, event processing
- **Key Features**: Auto-scaling, cost-effectiveness
